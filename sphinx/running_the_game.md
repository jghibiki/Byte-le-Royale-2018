# Running The Game

## Installation

***Note: The game has not been tested on MacOS. Linux or Windows are recommended.*** 

### Windows

1. Install Python 3.6: Download Python 3.6 or newer from the [Python Official Website](python.org)

2. Install the [Github Client](https://desktop.github.com/)

3. Using the Github Client clone the game repository 
    - ```https://github.com/jghibiki/Mini-MechMania-2017-2018.git```

4. Using a Windows Command Prompt, change directory to where you clone the repository. 
    - As a shortcut, browse to the directory using Windows Explorer, and hold shift while right clicking in the folder. This will add an option to the context menu that says "Open Command Propmt Here". Click this button to open a command prompt in this directory.
    
5. In the command prompt type the following to install game requirements.
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Linux
1. Install Python 3.6 via your distro's package manager.

2. Clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/jghibiki/Mini-MechMania-2017-2018.git
```
3. Change directory into the repository and run
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Game

Basic flow of how a game works:
1. Start a server
2. Start a client. Your client will connect to the server. 
3. The server then orchestrates the game based on the ```game_data.json``` file and responses from the client. The server also generates a ```game_log/``` directory which contains the game log which is used by the visualizer to visualize the game after it has finished running.
4. Wait for the client and server to finish running.
5. Run the visualizer to visualize how the game played out.

***Note: All of the following commands must be run from the root of the repository.***

#### Generate Dungeon
Generates a dungeon ```game_data.json``` file. This file outlines a randomly generated dungeon.

```shell
python -m game.scripts.generate
```

#### Easy Run Script
***Only works for Linux***

Runs both the client and server.
```shell
./run.sh
```

#### Run Server
Runs the game server. 

```shell
python -m game.scripts.server
```

#### Run Client
Runs the default client (```custom_client.py```).

```shell
python -m game.scripts.client
```

Run a custom client defined in the root of the repository (e.g. ```demo_client.py```). Note that you do not include the ```.py```.

```shell
python -m game.scripts.client --client demo_client
```
