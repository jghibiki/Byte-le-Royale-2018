# Installing

***Note: The game has not been tested on MacOS. Linux or Windows are recommended.*** 

## Recommended Install (Windows & Linux)

1. Install [Pycharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).
2.  Start Pycharm.

<br>
3. Click "Checkout from version control and then git.
<br>

<br>
4. Now we will clone the github repository. This copys the remote code repository to your local machine.
    1. Fill in fields
        - ***Git Repository URL:*** ```https://github.com/jghibiki/Byte-le-Royale-2018```
        - ***Parent Directory:*** Use the ```...``` to select where you would like to download the code to.
        - ***Directory Name:*** ```Byte-le Royale```
    2. Click ```Clone```
<br>

<br>
5. Now we need to set up a virtual environment for PyCharm. A virtual environment is a sandbox for installing python libraries.
    1. Click File -> Settings
    2. In the settings window, click on the triangle next to ```Project: Byte-le ...``` and then click ```Project Interpreter```
    <br>

    <br>
    3. Click on the gear icon, then click on ```Add Local```
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="_static/gearPic.png" style="width:500px"/>
    <br>
    4. In the window that appears, rename the ```venv``` directory to ```.venv```. This will help prevent git from attempting to track changes to this python virtual environment.
    <br>
    <img src="_static/venvPic.png" style="width:800px"/>
    <br>
6. Now that we have set up a virtual environment, we need to install the python libraries required for the game. 
    1. To do this, go to the file browser on the left, and open the ```custom_client.py``` file in the root of the repository. In the top right corner of the file you should see the following bar pop up after a few seconds.
    <img src="_static/installReqs.png" style="width:800px"/>
    2. Click on install requirements, and click Ok/Install Requirements on the window that pops up.
    3. In the lower right corner you should see a progress bar pop up. When this bar reaches 100% the python requirements have been installed successfully.
    <img src="_static/installProgress.png" style="width:800px"/>
7. Now that we have set up a virtual environment, we need to set the working directory for some helper scripts.
    1. Select ```Edit Configurations``` from the dropdown menu in the upper right corner of the main menu.
    <br>
    <img src="_static/edit_configs_dropdown.png" style="width:400px"/>
    <br>
    2. In the new window, for each script listed on the left, click on the ```...``` next to the text box for ```Working Directory``` and navigate to the root of the repository, then click apply.
    <br>
    <img src="_static/edit_configs.png" style="width:700px"/>
    <br>

7. To verify that everything is working, select ```Generate Map``` from the dropdown list in the upper right corner of the main window. Then click the green arrow next to the dropdown to run the script. A panel should pop up displaying the output of the script.
<br>

## Manual Install

### Windows
***Note: This installation method is not recommended. The PyCharm installation will be much easier to use and provides the benefit of the PyCharm Debugger.***

1. Install Python 3.6: Download Python 3.6 or newer from the [Python Official Website](python.org)

2. Install the [Github Client](https://desktop.github.com/)

3. Using the Github Client clone the game repository 
    - ```https://github.com/jghibiki/Byte-le-Royale-2018.git```

4. Using a Windows Command Prompt, change directory to where you clone the repository. 
    - As a shortcut, browse to the directory using Windows Explorer, and hold shift while right clicking in the folder. This will add an option to the context menu that says "Open Command Propmt Here". Click this button to open a command prompt in this directory.
    
5. In the command prompt type the following to install game requirements.
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Linux
***Note: This installation method is not recommended. The PyCharm installation will be much easier to use and provides the benefit of the PyCharm Debugger.***
