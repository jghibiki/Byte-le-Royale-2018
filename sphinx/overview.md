# Dungeon Delvers Overview

## The Event
Lead your fearless adventurers into the depths of the earth with the magical language of Python. Gather gold, fame, and glory to become the envy of your fellow competitors. 

Once the event starts, you will have 24 hours to build the best team. Never forget though, sleep is essential to successful adventuring. Get plenty of sleep! 

## The Goal

The goal is to collect more trophies than any other party of adventurers. Your task is to program the most capable party of adventurers who will traverse randomly generated dungeons to earn as many trophies as possible. Gold and trophies are awarded for killing [monsters](#monsters) but beware - monsters can be very deadly. The more dangerous a monster the more gold will be rewarded. Gold can be spent in [town](#towns) to purchase better weapons and spells for your party. [Traps](#traps), while still dangerous, allow your party to avoid monsters that are too challenging.


## The Basics

Controlling your adventurers will be as simple as using a basic Python API, which will command your units to take various actions. 

The game is made up of several phases. These phases are best described as different rooms or locations. The first location your team will visit each game is a Town (for more about towns see [Towns](#towns) and [Purchasing Items](~documentation/items.html#purchasing-items)). Once you are done in town, your party will venture out into various dungeons. A dungeon is made up of many rooms. Clearing a dungeon will allow you to return to town whereupon your team will be fully rested and healed. These dungeons will be of increasing length and difficulty so you will need to carefully plan how to survive. Once you clear a room in a dungeon you will be allowed a sneak-peek at what lies beyond. If there are two doors, you will be given the choice of which door to enter (see [Choosing Your Path](#choosing-your-path)).


The following code, is an example of a bare-bones client. A client is made up of several methods which will be called automatically by the networking mechanisms of the client which are implemented by inheriting the UserClient super-class. At the beginning of each method, there is a description of what each event-handling method does.

*Note: Tampering with any variables or methods defined by the UserClient method will be considered cheating and you will be disqualified.*

## Towns
In towns units are allowed to purchase new weapons, spells and armor if they have enough gold. The first room your units will be able to enter each game is town #0. At each town the availability of items is dependent on what number the town is. For example in town #0 you will be able to purchase level 2 weapons and level 1 spells and bombs.
